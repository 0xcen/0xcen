## 👷🏽‍♂️ What I'm working on
I'm really enjoying building [MoonBots](https://moonbots.co) 🚀, a suite of tools for communities on [<img src="https://solana.com/_next/static/media/solanaLogo.74d35f7a.svg" width="75px"/>](https://solana.com/). The blockchain is very interesting technology and understanding how to interact with it has been a blast.

## 📓 What I'm learning now
Right now I'm working on getting comfortable with Typescript <img src="https://cdn.svgporn.com/logos/typescript-icon.svg" height="15px"/> (and loving it ❤️) because runtime errors are no bueno 👎.

🌁 Lately, when I'm not writing code or learning something new, I take long walks and listen to podcasts about [how great businesses are built](https://artofproductpodcast.com/), or [how great artists work](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ouCALWL15Hxbgk9f8yqhY).
